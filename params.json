{"name":"Pkg-config","tagline":"Mirror of git://anongit.freedesktop.org/pkg-config","body":"pkg-config is a script to make putting together all the build\r\nflags when compiling/linking a lot easier.\r\n\r\nReport bugs at http://bugzilla.freedesktop.org/\r\n\r\nTo use pkg-config, do something like the following in your configure.ac\r\n\r\n    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GNOME], [gtk > 1.2.8 gnomeui >= 1.2.0])\r\n\r\nThis puts the neccesary include flags to compile/link something against\r\nlibgnomeui and all its dependencies in $(GNOME_CFLAGS), and the -L/-l flags\r\nfor linking in $(GNOME_LIBS).\r\n\r\nUsers can define the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to point at the\r\nright one, or if they cross-compile and have a correctly named pkg-config\r\n(eg. arm-linux-pkg-config) in their PATH that will be used in preference.\r\n\r\nUsers can also define the GNOME_CFLAGS and GNOME_LIBS environment variables\r\nif they think they know better, pkg-config will not be called if they do\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe \"gtk > 1.2.8\" part is only neccesary if you want to specifically check\r\nif libgtk is version 1.2.8 or higher. Otherwise, the flags for gtk\r\nwill be included automatically, since libgnomeui depends on gtk.\r\nSo you could just say:\r\n\r\n     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([GNOME], [gnomeui])\r\n\r\nfor any version of gnomeui.\r\n\r\nFor more info, there's even a man page, try 'man pkg-config'\r\n\r\nBuilding\r\n========\r\npkg-config depends on glib.  Note that glib build-depends on pkg-config,\r\nbut you can just set the corresponding environment variables (ZLIB_LIBS,\r\nZLIB_CFLAGS are the only needed ones when this is written) to build it.\r\n\r\npkg-config also either needs an earlier version of itself to find glib\r\nor you need to set GLIB_CFLAGS and GLIB_LIBS to the correct values for\r\nwhere it's installed in your system.\r\n\r\nIf this requirement is too cumbersome, a bundled copy of a recent glib\r\nstable release is included. Pass --with-internal-glib to configure to\r\nuse this copy.\r\n\r\nIf you're cross-compiling and you need to build the bundled glib, refer\r\nto the glib documentation for cross-compiling glib. In short, this will\r\nrequire setting some autoconf cache variables in cases where glib would\r\nneed to run a program to determine the correct value. See the glib\r\ndocumentation:\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-cross-compiling.html\r\n\r\nIf you need to use the bundled glib on Mac OS X, you'll most likely need\r\nto build for a single architecture rather than as a universal binary.\r\nThis is because glib (as of version 2.32) does not support building for\r\nmultiple architectures out of the box. The glib2 from MacPorts or\r\nHomebrew may be available as a universal binary and usable for\r\npkg-config as described above. Nothing in pkg-config itself precludes\r\nbeing built as a universal binary.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
